# Current TODO Items for Ansible Docker Management
# Generated: 2025-08-31
# Status: Service â†’ Role mapping completed, ready for implementation

## IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES

### Service â†’ Role Implementation
[ ] Define 3 new roles discovered during mapping:
    [ ] youtube-sync (tubesync on papa-bear)
    [ ] signal-bridge (signal-cli on mama-bear)  
    [ ] network-monitoring (watchyourlan on mama-bear)

[ ] Make consolidation decisions for duplicate services:
    [ ] Mealie instances: consolidate to one host or keep separate?
    [ ] Portainer instances: centralize or keep distributed?
    [ ] SWAG instances: primary/backup or specialized configs?

[ ] Design baby-bear role assignments (currently unused capacity):
    [ ] Plan production workloads for 3.6TB unused storage
    [ ] Decide backup service strategy
    [ ] Consider development environment hosting

### Role Architecture Setup
[ ] Create Ansible role directory structure:
    [ ] roles/media-acquisition/ (transmission+jackett+radarr+sonarr)
    [ ] roles/plex-server/
    [ ] roles/reverse-proxy/ 
    [ ] roles/ddns-pancakefight-com/
    [ ] roles/ddns-duck-bar/
    [ ] roles/monero-node/
    [ ] + all other mapped roles

[ ] Start with one role implementation (suggest: media-acquisition)
[ ] Create role variable templates for each service type
[ ] Plan service migration from current to optimized distribution

## INFRASTRUCTURE TASKS

### Hardware Planning (Independent)
[ ] SSD Hardware Planning:
    [ ] Plan SSD redistribution based on service requirements
    [ ] Document which services need SSD performance vs bulk storage
    [ ] Create SSD swap procedure using hardware identification (INFRA.md)

### Hostname Migration (Independent - Complete plan in NOTES.md)  
[ ] Plan hostname migration process:
    [ ] Create hostname change playbooks (overkill-1 â†’ papa-bear, etc.)
    [ ] Update Ansible inventory with new names
    [ ] Test hostname changes with baby-bear first

### Critical Storage Issue
[ ] URGENT: mama-bear storage cleanup (97% full - system failure risk)
    [ ] Free up space immediately
    [ ] Move large services to other hosts
    [ ] Monitor disk usage

## CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT

### Environment & Secrets
[ ] Create environment variable inventory per host
[ ] Design secrets management strategy (Ansible Vault)
[ ] Document external storage mount requirements

### Service Dependencies  
[ ] Create service dependency mapping
[ ] Build docker-compose management roles vs native container roles
[ ] Plan rolling deployment strategy for zero-downtime updates

### Backup & Recovery
[ ] Design backup automation for container configs and data
[ ] Document current backup/restore procedures for each service
[ ] Create disaster recovery runbook for complete stack recreation

## MONITORING & MAINTENANCE

### Service Health
[ ] Test network connectivity between services
[ ] Document current SSL certificate management (SWAG)
[ ] Plan monitoring and alerting integration with existing services

### Documentation
[ ] Investigate brisk-falcon intended usage and potential services
[ ] Update all documentation with role-based architecture
[ ] Create runbooks for common operations

## DISCOVERED DOMAIN MANAGEMENT
- pancakefight.com + www.pancakefight.com managed by papa-bear (overkill-1)
- duck.bar + ntfy.duck.bar managed by mama-bear (greasy-gold)
- Both use Namecheap as DNS provider

## SERVICE MAPPING STATUS
âœ… 15 services mapped to existing roles
ðŸ†• 3 new roles needed (youtube-sync, signal-bridge, network-monitoring)  
ðŸ¤” Consolidation decisions needed for 6 duplicate services
ðŸ“‹ baby-bear available for new role assignments

## HARDWARE IDENTIFICATION (for SSD swaps)
- papa-bear: 192.168.1.100, MAC 5a:16:21:3a:45:18, E5-2697 v3 CPU
- mama-bear: 192.168.1.149, MAC 62:a6:e5:80:6a:c4, E5-1650 v2 CPU  
- baby-bear: 192.168.1.135, MAC 86:43:76:1a:a9:2e, E5-1620 CPU

## NEXT SESSION PRIORITIES
1. Define the 3 new roles (youtube-sync, signal-bridge, network-monitoring)
2. Make consolidation decisions for duplicate services
3. Plan baby-bear production role assignments
4. Create first role implementation (suggest: media-acquisition)
5. Address mama-bear storage crisis
